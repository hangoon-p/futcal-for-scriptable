# Futcal for Scriptable
Futcal is a football widget for [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) that relies on the [FotMob](https://www.fotmob.com) API data.

With Futcal you can choose your favourite team and quickly see:
* Last match
    * Competition and round
    * Home and Away teams
    * Result
* Next match
    * Competition and round
    * Home and Away teams
    * Time and date (or current result and playing time if match is ongoing)
* League table
    * Position, Team, Matches played, Wins, Draws, Losses and Points

## Features
### üì± First-Party Design

Futcal was built with simplicity and consistency in mind, with a design based on the Apple Calendar widget.
The goal is to fit in with other Apple widgets while providing at a glance all the information you are looking for.

Note: The widget was developed and tested on an iPhone XS. Minor changes on the position of the different elements may occur for devices with different screen sizes.

### üåô Dark Mode

Futcal supports different color configurations for light and dark mode.
The default colors are fully aligned with the Apple Calendar widget, for consistency.

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Different Sizes

Futcal is prepared to support multiple languages, based on your device system settings. This applies to all default UI elements but also specific API information (e.g. competition or round name).
Currently the following languages are available:
* Czech
* English
* French (thanks to [@Write](https://github.com/Write) for the help translating)
* German (thanks to [@lcshmn](https://github.com/lcshmn) and [@ostoer](https://github.com/ostoer) for the help translating)

* Portuguese
* Spanish

If you would like other languages to be added feel free to create a ticket and share the translation strings. I will gladly add them.

Note: If your device language is not supported, the widget will default to English.

### üëÜ Tap To Open
Clicking any of the widget different sections will open additional details on Safari or on the FotMob iOS/iPadOS application, if installed.

Note: This overrides any behavior defined in the configuration of the widget

### ‚úàÔ∏è Offline Mode

## Known Issues
* **Tap To Open**: There is currently an iOS/iPadOS limitation where any URLs opened through a widget will require its host app (in this case Scriptable) to launch first, before the URL can be opened.
* **Refresh rate**: The refresh rate of a widget is partly up to iOS/iPadOS. For example, a widget may not refresh if the device is low on battery or the user is rarely looking at the widget.
